## Overview

A decentralized voting platform built on Ethereum blockchain ensuring transparent, secure, and immutable voting processes.

## Features

- **Decentralized**: No central authority controls the votes
- **Immutable**: Votes cannot be altered once recorded
- **Transparent**: All votes are publicly verifiable on blockchain
- **Multi-Option**: Support for multiple voting choices
- **Secure**: Cryptographic security of Ethereum blockchain

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vue 3
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Web3 Integration**: Web3.js
- **Wallet**: MetaMask integration

## Development Period

February 2025

## Smart Contract Features

```solidity
- Create new votes
- Cast votes
- View results
- Prevent double voting
- Time-bounded voting periods
```

## Learning Outcomes

This project was developed after completing the Educative course "Building a Blockchain from Scratch Using Solidity and Ethereum".

Key learnings:

- Writing and deploying Solidity smart contracts
- Interacting with Ethereum blockchain from frontend
- Managing wallet connections
- Gas optimization techniques
- Security best practices in smart contracts

## Security Considerations

- Reentrancy protection
- Access control mechanisms
- Input validation
- Overflow/underflow protection
